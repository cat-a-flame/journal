I have to confess, I'm not very good at taking care of plants, even though I enjoy having them in my home.

Over a year ago, I mustered up the courage to buy two plants: a Snowflower and a Monstera adansonii. The Snowflower is good for people who don't have much experience with plants, but the Monstera requires more advanced care.

Before choosing these plants, I made sure that the room was suitable for them. We live in a twin house, which means that we don't have windows on the eastern side, making some rooms darker. The air is pretty dry, especially in the winter.

How can you make sure that a room is good for a specific plant? How to make sure they survive? This is where [Planta](https://getplanta.com/) comes in.

Planta is a mobile app that helps you take care of your plants by providing you with all the necessary information and reminders. Whether you are a beginner or a seasoned gardener, Planta can help you keep your plants healthy and thriving.

As a first step, you need to add your skill level and how much effort you are willing to put into caring for your plants.

Next, you need to create sites. Each site has its own details, such as how much natural light it receives (where are the windows facing), what the humidity is like, and whether there is a draft. The app uses this information to determine the best environment for your plant and provides you with suggestions on how to improve your plant’s health.

Once you've set up your sites, Planta can recommend plants based on your skill level and which ones could survive in the chosen location.

When you add a plant, the app will ask you a few questions about it, such as its name, size, location, and watering schedule. Here is an example of one of my plants:

        <figcaption>Example care schedule of my Monstera</figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>

After you have added a plant, Planta will create a custom schedule based on the information you have provided. In the free version, the app will only remind you about watering and give you guidelines on how to do that, as well as what you need to check before watering your plant.

I have been using the free version for more than a year, and it has served me well. So, if you don't want to pay, you'll be just fine.

With the premium features, you get more care details, such as fertilizing, cleaning, and repotting. Planta also has a pretty neat premium feature called Dr. Planta, which helps you identify issues with your plant and set up a treatment plan.

In conclusion, [Planta](https://getplanta.com/) is an excellent app for anyone who wants to take care of their plants without feeling overwhelmed. The app’s intuitive interface and personalized care plans make it easy and enjoyable to take care of your plants. With Planta, you can turn your home into a green oasis and enjoy the many benefits of having plants around you.
