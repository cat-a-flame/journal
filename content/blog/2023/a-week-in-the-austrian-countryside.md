My partner knew of a great town called Obervellach, where he used to spend a week every summer when he was in elementary school. Since I had never been anywhere else besides Vienna in Austria, it sounded promising to me.

I searched for accommodations on booking.com and quickly found a place called Ranacherhof. It's a farm that also rents rooms for visitors. Judging by the photos, we quickly decided to book the room.

## Obervellach
It's a small market town located in the valley of the Alps in the Austrian state of Carinthia. During our visit in the off-season, we only met local folks, and they all greeted us with big smiles.

Although it was a tiring six-hour drive from our home, as we got closer to our destination, we quickly fell in love with the breathtaking views of the Alps.

## Ranacherhof
During our visit to Obervellach, we stayed at [Ranacherhof](https://www.ranacherhof.com/), which is a beautiful farm located halfway up the mountain. The farm is home to cows, ducks, rabbits, quails, goats, two lovely cats, and a cute dog. Our host was very friendly, and she served us breakfast every morning. We were pleasantly surprised to find that the breakfast consisted of homemade products, including cheese, ham, eggs, and honey, all of which were incredibly delicious.

Our room at Ranacherhof had a stunning view from its balcony, and we could see the whole town of Obervellach. One of the highlights of our stay was witnessing how they milk the cows. We were able to watch the process and even try it ourselves, which was a unique and memorable experience.

## Day 2
Unfortunately, most of the hiking trails and tourist attractions were closed because it was still skiing season. Despite this setback, we were determined to find some entertainment and decided to visit the [Barbarossaschlucht](https://www.tourismus-muehldorf.at/sport-freizeit/wandern/barbarossaschlucht/), which is a natural gorge.
It is a popular destination for hikers and tourists who come to admire its natural beauty. Although we were a little hesitant to visit because we were not sure what to expect, we decided to give it a try.

The trail was quite tiring, but the stunning views along the way made it all worthwhile. We were surrounded by beautiful trees, mountains, and the sound of a nearby river. As we made our way through the gorge, we were mesmerized by the natural beauty of the rock formations and the crystal-clear water.

## Day 3
The weather was a bit whimsical that day, and it looked like it might rain, so going for a hike seemed like a bad idea. We decided to do smaller activities instead.

First, we went to visit the [Porsche Museum](http://www.auto-museum.at/) in Gm√ºnd. During World War II, they moved their manufacturing to this little town to avoid the bombings. Sadly, the museum is not in the same building as their factory was back then.

After finishing at the museum, we visited a [donkey farm](http://www.eselpark.at/index.php/home)! It was basically a petting zoo with alpacas, goats, peacocks, rabbits, camels, various types of birds, and of course, cats!

The place had a friendly atmosphere, even though one of the alpacas attacked my partner. No one got injured, so no worries!

## Day 4
It was a day for rest. I got exhausted from the previous days, and the weather was unfriendly too.

## Day 5
We gathered many brochures to find some activities because, as I mentioned in the beginning, there was not much to do besides skiing. In one of the pamphlets, I found a [museum for Bonsai plants](https://www.bonsai.at/)! It is basically a Japanese garden in Austria. It has been there for 40 years, and even in April, it had a stunning view! So many plants, flowers, trees, and lakes can be found here. The owner was really kind too.

After spending an hour and a half here, we had some lunch in Spittal and then visited [Sommeregg castle](https://www.sommeregg.at/). The view from its top was breathtaking! I have been to many castles before, but this one just jumped into my top 3 shortlist.

## Day 6
Hiking day!
Finally, the weather was super awesome, so it was time to visit [Seebachtal](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/austria/carinthia/naturlehrweg-seebachtal), which is a long but easy trail.
We walked around 7 kilometres, and it took us about 3 hours, but it was worth it! The scenery was stunning, but let my photos speak for themselves:
