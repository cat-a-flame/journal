title: Things I wish I have known earlier
lead: "I have been in IT for 13 years, and boy, I had some rough times in the beginning. It took me years to overcome several of my frustrations and better understand this industry. If I could say a few things to my younger self, these would be on my list."

## 1. Keeping your mind sharp is essential
One way to do this is by working on open-source projects.

Working at a large enterprise company, we may not always have the luxury of using the latest technologies or flashy tools due to various reasons. However, it's important to recognize that not using the latest applications or frameworks can be a reality in some companies.

To stay up-to-date with the latest technologies, it's recommended to work on side projects, even as a hobby. This will help you keep your mind sharp and improve your confidence during job interviews.

## 2. Switching companies is how you make more money
Companies have to stay competitive in the market, which results in offering better compensation packages for new hires. Usually, your employer forbids talking about your salary publicly for a reason, as it could result in conflicts. However, it's important to keep in mind that career growth, job satisfaction, and work-life balance should also be considered when making career moves.

## 3. You don't have to know all the latest technologies
While it's beneficial to keep up with the latest technologies, employers understand that technology is constantly evolving, and they often look for candidates who have the ability to learn and adapt on the job. During the interview process, it's important to showcase your problem-solving and critical-thinking abilities, as these skills are highly valued in the industry.  And, as I mentioned earlier, not every company has the opportunity to use the latest technologies.

## 4. Keep track of your achievements
Every little achievement counts, even if some of those are outside of your role! This helps you keep track of how much you have grown and how far you have came.

## 5. Trust no one but yourself
May sound like a cliche, but it's true that nobody in your life wants your happiness as much as you do. Okay, maybe your family does, but outside of your cozy, safe home, it's a wild, wild west out there. Employers may say nice things like "we're a family" and "we care," but they only care as long as the revenues are high.

Your mental and physical health are your responsibility. Learn to say no, set boundaries, and recognize toxic traits.
